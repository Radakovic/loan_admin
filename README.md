## ðŸ’¿ Install process
In your terminal execute command to get source code of project
`git@github.com:Radakovic/loan_admin.git`

This project uses Docker as working container for running application. To continue with installation you have to have installed
Docker and Docker Compose.

After you clone project execute one of fallowing commands needed for start project:

- Execute all migrations
- Create fixture data

After completing the installation, your application will run on this port: `http://localhost:8082/`
